# User Roles

Users in Janus can have one of two roles.  Admin and User.

## Admin

Admins have full access to every feature and config item in Janus.  The role does not give default access to all projects,
however it does give permission to edit project permissions and therefore the admin can grant themselves access.

## User

Users have access to the projects they are assigned to.  They can view the project, create and edit jobs, and view logs.  They cannot
edit project permissions, create new projects or access any configuration/admin items.

## Notes

When changing a users role the effect is immediate, no need to log out and back in.
