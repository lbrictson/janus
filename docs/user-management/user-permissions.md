# User Permissions

User permissions are what grant users access to a particular project.  Users can only access projects that they have an assigned
permission to.  

There are three levels of user permissions in Janus.  Editor, User, No Access.

## Editor

Editors have full access to the project.  They can create and edit jobs, view logs, rename the project, add/remove/view secrets and delete jobs.

## User

Users can run a job but not view or edit it. They can view the logs of jobs as they execute as well as historical runs.  Users
cannot edit projects, secrets, or jobs.

## No Access

Users with no access cannot access the project at all.
