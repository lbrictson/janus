# Versioning

When a job is edited a new version of that job is created.  Janus tracks an unlimited number of versions of a job.  This allows you to revert to a previous version of a job if you make a mistake.

## Behavior

When a job is edited a new version is created.  The new version is a copy of the previous version with the changes you made.  The previous version is not modified.

## Viewing Versions

To view the versions of a job, click the "Versions" tab on the job detail page.  From there you can view an old version and when viewing it optionally hit "Restore Version" to
revert the job to this previous version.
